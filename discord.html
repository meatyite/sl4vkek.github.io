  Discord sucks
 </h1>
 <p>
  Discord sucks. Not only because it's proprietary software, its the
  <em>
   the worst kind
  </em>
  of proprietary. They actively pursue not only companies, but
  <em>
   users
  </em>
  who committed the evil act of.. uh.. inserting CSS to make a chat client looks better?
  <br/>
  Let me explain.
  <a href="https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp">
   BetterDiscord
  </a>
  is a free-software modification for the discord client which, to put it simply, inserts custom CSS into the client, which simply changes the U.I. Nothing less, nothing more.
Now, let me explain further. Discord
  <em>
   actively looks for
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   bans
  </em>
  users who are caught using the modification. Why? why is enforcement of this necessary?
  <br/>
  Another thing discord bans users for, is using free-software clients. Personally I don't understand that. If I was a big software proprietor, I would let people use those because either way it would make me money. The same data is being collected, stored, and then later sold to advertisers. It would not make any difference in profits. And even if it did, a little less money is better than no money?? I really don't understand.
  <br/>
  This really is an example of how proprietary software, and Copyright laws in general, does not breed innovation, but rather discourage it.
