  Electron is horrible
 </h1>
 <p>
  Who fucking wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself,
  <i>
   "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT CAN BE COOL? LET'S WRITE A DESKTOP APP IN
   <b>
    HTML, JAVASCRIPT AND CSS!
   </b>
   OH OH OH! I HAVE AN IDEA! LET'S HAVE AN ENTIRE COPY OF CHROMIUM, A BROWSER INFAMOUS FOR HORRIBLE CPU USAGE, SHIPPED WITH OUR APP! AND THIS BROWSER
ISN'T SHARED WITH OTHER APPS USING THE SAME FRAMEWORK, SO YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO INSTALL THE SAME BROWSER MULTIPLE TIMES!"
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  On a serious note, Javascript is horrible. HTML-Based desktop GUI
  <i>
   can
  </i>
  be good
  <i>
   if done right
  </i>
  .
But my fucking god, stop using electron. It's bloated, it Tera-fucks your CPU, may I remind it runs on
  <i>
   Fucking javascript
  </i>
  ,
overall it sucks mad balls.
