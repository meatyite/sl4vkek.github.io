  Thinkpads are great
 </h1>
 <p>
  (older) Thinkpads are absolute computing perfection.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The keyboard actually makes sense, it's styled like a desktop's keyboard, the buttons are properly sized. Unlike modern laptops, they have a volume button,
   <i>
    I repeat, they have a volume button!
   </i>
   . F keys don't count shut up
  </li>
  <li>
   Don't prevent you from upgrading and reparing.
  </li>
  <li>
   Linux on Thinkpads work flawlessly.
  </li>
  <li>
   There is an abundance of used Thinkpads for cheap on 2nd hand sites. Craigslist, Gumtree, whatever.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Best models imo are T420, T450, x260, x200 or x60.
